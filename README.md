## Base Gas Price Tracker Extension

Displays recent gas prices of different networks at 10-minute intervals. Notifies when the gas price is below a set
threshold.
Fee volatility can swing from 400 to 37k Mwei in hours, that can be a difference of paying $0.05 or $50 for a swap.

So if you're not in a hurry, save on your onchain swaps and bridges! Optimize your transactions with low gas prices.

- Monitor recent gas prices across various ETH-based networks every 10 minutes.
- Receive notifications when gas prices dip below your set threshold.

Iâ€™ve powered this tool with the Etherscan API.
